# Tackle_Noise_with_Error_Correction
 This project will explore quantum error correction using the repetition code from Qiskit's guide. We will encode information across multiple qubits to detect and correct bit-flip errors, implement the code in Qiskit, test error resilience, and analyze performance, providing foundational insights for advanced error correction techniques.
